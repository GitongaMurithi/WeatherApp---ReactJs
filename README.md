# Weather app

This is a simple Weather App built using React.js that allows users to check the current weather in various cities around the world. The app uses the 
[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API to fetch real-time weather data, displaying important details such as temperature, weather conditions, atmospheric pressure, and more.

## Core features
- `City Search` : Users can enter the name of a city to get the current weather data.
- `Error Handling` : If a user searches for an invalid city, an error message will be displayed, guiding them to try a different city.
- `Responsive Design` : The app is designed to work seamlessly across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- `Real-time Data` : Fetches and displays the latest weather data, including temperature (in Celsius), weather condition, pressure, humidity, and more.

## Technologies Used
- [React.js](https://react.dev/) : For building the user interface.
- [- OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/): For fetching weather data.
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) : For styling.
